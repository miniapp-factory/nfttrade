+Code the following app
+```
+Project Plan: NFTTrade – Mini NFT Exchange App
+1. Project Overview
+
+NFTTrade is a lightweight application that allows users to create, list, buy, sell, and exchange NFTs. The app focuses on simplicity, speed, and low transaction fees. It will integrate with a blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Polygon, or Solana) and support common NFT standards.
+
+2. Core Features
+2.1 User Accounts & Wallet Integration
+
+Connect external wallets (MetaMask, Phantom, WalletConnect).
+
+Display user balance, owned NFTs, and transaction history.
+
+Optional guest mode with limited functionality.
+
+2.2 NFT Listing & Browsing
+
+Browse NFTs by categories, price, trending, and newest.
+
+View NFT details: image, description, owner, contract address, and metadata.
+
+Search and filter functionality.
+
+2.3 NFT Minting
+
+Simple form to upload media (image/video).
+
+Add metadata (name, description, attributes).
+
+Mint NFT to selected blockchain.
+
+2.4 Buying & Selling NFTs
+
+List NFTs for sale at a fixed price or via auction.
+
+Initiate secure blockchain transactions.
+
+Automatic update of ownership after purchase.
+
+2.5 Trading / Swapping NFTs
+
+Peer-to-peer NFT swap system between users.
+
+Two-party confirmation mechanism.
+
+Optional additional payment during the swap.
+
+2.6 Activity Feed & Notifications
+
+Track sales, bids, and new listings.
+
+Real-time updates using WebSockets or blockchain event listeners.
+
+3. Technology Stack
+Frontend
+
+React / Next.js
+
+TypeScript
+
+Web3.js or Ethers.js
+
+TailwindCSS or Material UI
+
+Backend
+
+Node.js + Express
+
+API for user profiles, metadata storage, and listing management
+
+Optional: serverless functions (AWS Lambda / Vercel)
+
+Blockchain
+
+Ethereum (ERC-721, ERC-1155)
+
+Or: Solana (Metaplex), Polygon, BNB Chain
+
+IPFS for decentralized storage (via Pinata or NFT.Storage)
+
+Database
+
+MongoDB / Firebase / PostgreSQL
+
+Store user profiles, listings, and caching of metadata
+
+4. Architecture Overview
+
+Client communicates with backend API for listing and metadata.
+
+Blockchain interactions happen directly through the user’s wallet.
+
+Metadata stored on IPFS; only references stored in database.
+
+Backend listens to blockchain events to update states (ownership, sales).
+
+5. Development Stages
+Stage 1: Planning & Design
+
+Define user flows and core features.
+
+Create UI/UX mockups (Figma).
+
+Choose blockchain and NFT standards.
+
+Stage 2: Environment Setup
+
+Configure frontend and backend structures.
+
+Set up blockchain development environment (Hardhat/Foundry).
+
+Create development smart contracts.
+
+Stage 3: Smart Contract Development
+
+NFT minting contract (ERC-721/ERC-1155).
+
+Marketplace contract (buy/sell functions).
+
+Swap/trade contract (two-party exchange).
+
+Deploy to testnet (Goerli, Mumbai, etc.).
+
+Stage 4: Frontend Integration
+
+Connect wallet integration.
+
+Implement minting, listing, and buying UIs.
+
+Display NFTs using metadata from IPFS.
+
+Stage 5: Backend & Database
+
+User and listing management APIs.
+
+Store metadata references and activity logs.
+
+Implement security (JWT, rate limiting).
+
+Stage 6: Testing & Optimization
+
+Smart contract audits.
+
+UI testing across multiple devices.
+
+Load testing for marketplace operations.
+
+Stage 7: Deployment
+
+Deploy frontend (Vercel/Netlify).
+
+Deploy backend (AWS/DigitalOcean).
+
+Deploy smart contracts to mainnet.
+
+Stage 8: Launch & Maintenance
+
+Add analytics and monitoring.
+
+Regular updates and bug fixes.
+
+Roll out new features: staking, royalties, multi-chain support.
+
+6. Additional Features (Optional)
+
+NFT fractionalization
+
+Social features (likes, comments, follows)
+
+Multi-chain bridge for NFTs
+
+Mobile app version (React Native / Flutter)
+```
+
+Generate an app logo and update the app metadata title and description.
